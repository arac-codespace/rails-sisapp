# README

A simple web app for my systers to mess around with and for me to practice 
my infant coding skills.

Creating this website has been a very entertaining and educational journey.  
There's indeed no better way to learn than to get hands on experience doing
things yourself.

While creating this website, I've become much more familiar with the concept
of object-oriented programing and rails take on it.  For instance, at first
I had a very vague understanding of what a controller and a model was.  Now,
while I'm far from being an expert I do at least have a better idea of how it all
works in the context of rails.  I also have a better idea as to its capabilities
and the supporting technologies behind it.

Having said that, there are a lot of things that even I know I've done
unsatisfactorily that I'll definitly look to improve on in my next project.

The first and probably most obvious one is the seemingly excesive ammount of
models, controllers and in turn, view files.  Best practices says to avoid repetition and I've gone
and done the exact opposite.  Alas, most of this stems from my lack of understanding and
experience in setting up/planning routes and relational databases.

And precisely, my biggest regret while doing this project was not being able
to set up a proper relational database.  By the time I sort of understood how
I'd be able to set one up, a big chunk of the site was already written.  By then 
It would've been more efficient for me to start over.  


I decided to finish the site instead of trying to start from scratch, but
of course, that doesn't mean that I will not be rewriting this page in the
future.  Hopefully by then I'll be able to create a much prettier site code-wise.

So, what next?  I'm planning to polish/better familiarize myself with ruby before moving on to 
learn javascript.  I feel like learning a new language when I'm so new with ruby
will only be a detriment to my learning.  So while I'm eager to learn JS, I'll
be pushing it back for a little while longer.  I'll also be fiddling with relational
databases in meanwhile.

Hopefully I'll be messing around with JS and relational databases come my next project.
